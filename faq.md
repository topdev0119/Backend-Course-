# Frequently Asked Questions

- Q: How can I enroll in the course?
  + A: Just start doing the tasks in [Stage 0. Self-Study](https://github.com/kottans/backend/blob/master/contents.md). Stage 0 is freely available to everyone. If you succeed in making all the Stage 0 tasks in time and pass the interview, you will be enrolled in main course (offline lectures). Keep an eye on our [public channel](https://twitter.com/kottans_org) and [chat]
- Q: Do I need to register for the course?
  + A: No, no formal registration needed. Just start with tasks.
- Q: How much time do I have to finish online tasks?
  + A: Approximately 3 months starting with 09.09.19, but there are no hard deadlines yet announced. The program is new and may be adjusted to the average results of the group.
- Q: I don't live in Kyiv. Do you have courses in my city?
  + A: So far Kyiv only, but we try to put as much materials as possible online.
- Q: I don't live in Kyiv. Can I do the course remotely?
  + A: You can certainly do Stage 0. All the communications related to this stage will be held online. As for Main course, it is designed to be taken in an offline group, but feel free to got through the materials as a self-study and to ask questions.
  
  Once again, don't forget:
1) we are not paid to do this
2) answering same questions over and over takes time, that could be used to make materials for this course better
3) don't be rude, everyone likes talking to nice people
4) there's a person on the other end of the screen.
