# JavaScript & NodeJS Basics. Part I

**Important note.** In NodeJS course we expect students to be familiar with JavaScript before starting the main part of the course. Here is a list of topics you should be confident with:

1. Array methods (filter, map, reduce etc.)
1. ES6 features: arrow functions, classes
1. Promises, async/await
1. ES6 modules (import/export syntax)
1. Functions in depth: higher-order functions, callbacks, function composition

If you need to catch up, you can use the following materials for self-study: [JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/js-basics.md)

## Task

In this task you will get familiar with some features of NodeJS which you may have never seen in frontend development. Also you will take a closer look a JavaScript functions. Please complete the following workshops from [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/):

- [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode)
- [functional-javascript-workshop](https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop)
- [stream adventure](https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure)

1. Make a screenshot of your completed workshops and put the screenshot in `node_basic_1` folder in your `kottans-backend` repo.

2. In your `kottans-backend` repo `README.md`
   - add header `## NodeJS Basics 1`
   - embed the screenshot or add a link to the screenshot
   - list your reflections on all subtasks (what was new to you, what surprised you, what you intend to use in future)

## Done?

➡️ Go forward to [Memory Management](memory-management.md)
