# JavaScript Basics. Part I

Important note. In NodeJS course we expect students to be familiar with JavaScript before starting the main part of the course. Here is a list of topics you should be confident with:

1. Array methods (filter, map, reduce etc.)
1. ES6 features: arrow functions, classes
1. Promises, async/await
1. ES6 modules (import/export syntax)
1. Functions in depth: higher-order functions, callbacks, function composition

If you need to catch up, you can use the following materials for self-study: [JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/js-basics.md) - list of materials suggested to frontend course students
