Read articles (1) and (2) and finish the course (3) above.

When complete do the following:
1. Make screenshots of your finished lessons from (3)
   and put the screenshots in `task_patterns` folder in
   your `kottans-backend` repo
1. In your `kottans-backend` repo `README.md`:
   * add header `## Patterns`
   * embed the screenshots or add links to the screenshots
   * list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. You did lot already! If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel][chat]:
   `Patterns — #done` (or `Patterns — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
