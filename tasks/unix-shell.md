# Unix Shell

Learn some command line, server and http tools.

1. [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

   **Note:** Completion of free content (Interactive Lessons) is the required minimum, but Quizzes and Freeform Projects should also be available via 7-day trial of Codecademy. Do them if you can, it's great practice.

2. Pass all Learning the Shell section on [linuxcommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/).

<!-- [Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253) -->
<!-- [Designing RESTful APIs](https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388) -->

Finish the course (1) and also read articles (2) and (3) above.

When complete do the following:

1. Make a screenshot of your finished lessons from (1)
   and put the screenshot in `task_unix_shell` folder in
   your `kottans-backend` repo
1. In your `kottans-backend` repo `README.md`:
   - add header `## Unix Shell`
   - embed the screenshot or add a link to the screenshot
   - list your reflections on all subtasks
     (_what was new to you_, _what surprised you_, _what you intend to use in future_)
1. If you honestly finished all the previous steps then go ahead
   and share it with others –
   post a message in [course channel](https://t.me/joinchat/Dqrdixe1c2K9bXUFBzNWtg):
   `Unix Shell — #done` (or `Unix Shell — #p2p_done` if you are p2p course student) and add the link to your repo. **This step is important, as it helps mentors to track your progress!**
1. Study Extra Materials below to improve your skills.
   If you feel it affects your overall course performance consider
   reverting to those later e.g. when you have all mandatory tasks completed.
1. You may skip Optional materials from this task (if any).

When you finish this task you can proceed to the next one.
